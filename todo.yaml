Tree:
  - Self-awareness - .contexttree (or similar) branch
  - Serialization to file
    - Values
    - Actions
  - Type safety
    - Action parameter tree (generation?)
    - Action argument validation according to parameter tree
  + Removal of nodes (just test delete action)
  - Read-only nodes
  - In-tree links support?
  - Easy creation of custom nodes from python classes
    - Find a way to implement @name, @path and @parent for every Node
      ? Implement @parent virtual attribute (with in-tree links?)
    ? Decorators:
      + Sort after dynamic node creation
        ? Create nodes in order in which decorators were defined
      + Take care of automatic parameter encapsulation (e.g. from Node<int> to just bare int)
      + @Attribute decorator
        - Add attribute rewrite to work with bare python classes (use @CreatorFunction to do this?)
        - Add (nested) path parameter
      ? @Subnode decorator
      + @Action decorator
        + Support for subactions
        + Add method rewrite to work with bare python classes
        + Add (nested) path parameter
      - @VirtualNode - for on-request node generation (Node.append_node_generator)
  - Add 'Node.' prefix too all node-related actions
  - Customizable search path (or virtually merged branches)
  - Sessions/TreeViews
  - Server-client architecture
  - Index addressing
    - Anonymous (without name) nodes

Functionality:
  - System executables as actions
  - File-to-node mapping
  - select and selected actions
  - Date/Time types
    - System time reading
  - Filesystem mapping
    - copy, cut and paste actions (using select(ed) action?)
    - mime-type based file typing
  - create.int
  - create.string
  - create.<type>
  - list.attributes
  - list.actions
  - list.all
  - list.nodes
  - select/selected
    - temporary/session storage
    - links
    - anonymous keys

Shell:
  - Autocompletion/suggestions
  - Server-client architecture
  - Branch navigation action (aka cd); should be in session?
  - Command invocation wizard (based on command's parameter tree)
  - set syntax sugar - .some.key = 321
  - get syntax sugar - .some.key (should be translated to .some.key: get if possible)
  - Command output streaming - list | filter | ...
  - Field streaming - {list}|.@name (based on command output streaming; filter?)
  - Batch calling - {selected}: play
